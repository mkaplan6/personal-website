        Hey! My name is Malcolm and I'm a student of Computer Science and Anthropology at UIUC. <br></br>
        "What a strange combination of fields," you're probably thinking. I agree, but at the same time <br></br>
        it's an awesome discipline that I can't praise enough. Through it, students gain the same <br></br>
        core knowledge of computer science as full CS majors as well as a strong background in the <br></br>
        humanities to provide a unique perspective on technological challenges. I think the most important<br></br>
        part of creating technology is making sure it is as user-friendly and helpful as possible for anyone <br></br>
        who uses it. My interests include software engineering, computer-human interaction, web design, UI/UX<br></br>
        design, and game design. I am also interested in the anthropological subfields of archaeology, <br></br>
        sociocultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Outside of class, I play drums in a rock band called "The Dads" (videos on the Music tab!). I love all kinds <br></br>
        of pop punk and alternative rock music, my favorite bands being blink-182, Angels and Airwaves, and <br></br>
        Sum 41. I'm also huge fan of hard video games like Dark Souls and Sekiro and I love photo and <br></br>
        video editing, oftentimes creating memes I post to YouTube and Instagram. <br></br>
      </p> */}
